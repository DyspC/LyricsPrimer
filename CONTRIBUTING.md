# Contributing

Here are the few rules you should follow if you want to push changes to this repository:
- The code is tab-indented
- Don't add new commented out lines, alternatives to your implementation can be discussed in the PR itself
- You can create/add a line to a CONTRIBUTORS.md file if you want to (but no links except to github.com profiles)
